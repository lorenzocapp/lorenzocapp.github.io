I contribute to the package [phylodyn](https://github.com/JuliaPalacios/phylodyn)

I have recently developed the package [adapref](https://github.com/lorenzocapp/adapref)

Most of my code is available on [github](https://github.com/lorenzocapp/)

Refer to [publications](https://lorenzocapp.github.io/publications/) to know which is the appropriate software for each method

If you are not able to find something, feel free to email me!
