I am a postdoctoral scholar in the [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.stanford.edu) at Stanford University, advised by Prof. [Julia A. Palacios](http://juliapalacios.github.io). I earned my Ph.D in Statistics in 2018 from the Department of Decision Sciences at the Bocconi University, under the supervision of Prof. [Stephen G. Walker](https://cns.utexas.edu/directory/item/15-mathematics/385-walker-stephen-g?Itemid=349) and Prof. [Sonia Petrone](http://faculty.unibocconi.eu/soniapetrone/). During my Ph.D, I was a visiting scholar at the Department of Statistics and Data Science at UT Austin. 

Research interests
======

I seek to provide computationally tractable methods and scalable algorithms that are tailored to big data problems. My research is motivated by concrete questions arising in applications - in particular, population genetics and applied mathematics - and I address these questions via statistical methods. My research spans theory and applications of statistical inference

* **Scalable coalescent-based inference**, working on alternative to Kingman coalescent to make inference feasible for large data sets

* **Statistical approaches to mathematical questions**, by framing some questions in combinatorics and applied mathematics as a statistical problem and solving those with tools from the statistical literature

* **Recursive algorithms in Bayesian statistics**, studying and developing recursive algorithms to approximate predictive distributions in Bayesian nonparametrics model

* **Phylodynamics**, by developing more accurate estimators of evolutionary parameters

* **Applications in infectious diseases and ancient DNA**, using coalescent methods to infer evolutionary parameters such as effective population size in order to monitor the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and to study question in anthropology
